# PixelDancerMath

PixelDancerMath or PXDMath is a library of math functions and data structures. It is based on dynamic loading library(DLL). Written with C++ 14. Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) is used in this project, so to use it in other projects you have to enable the AVX2 functionality from Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Enable Enhanced Instruction Set -> Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2).

## Aim

- Current aim is to integrate SIMD to math functions

- [x] AVX2 is implemented to Vector3D class.
