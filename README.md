# PixelDancerMath

PixelDancerMath or PXDMath is a library of math functions and data structures. Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) is used.

## Aim

- Current aim is to integrate SIMD to math functions

- [x] SSE2 is implemented to Vector2D class.
- [x] AVX2 is implemented to Vector3D class.
- [x] AVX2 is implemented to Vector4D class.
